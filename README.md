# DD3
=====

Distributed d3

Work done at the Data Science Institute of ICL.

This works on multiple local screens positionned as a screen wall.

It allows screens to communicate with peer.js and to get server data from signalR.

Screens have a browser running and get only part of the whole dataset from server.

Only one client code is needed and dd3 takes care of the vizualisation on a n x d screen wall.

This is a first version. Running version is on private ICL repository.
